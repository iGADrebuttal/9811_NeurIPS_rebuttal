# 1. The Updated Figure 1
1. We reorganize Figure 1. The step III appears behind steps I and II now.
2. In step II, we add the node id to highlight which paths the light blue nodes refer to from the input graph $G_N$.
3. We rewrite to caption of Figure 1 to make it easy to follow.

# 3. The Updated Figure 3 (Experiments under random walk length > 8 nodes )
1. We add M (the number of learnable substructures) and n' (the size of learnable substructures) to the caption of Figure 3.
2. We add the experiment result under the bigger size of random walk (> 8 nodes)
